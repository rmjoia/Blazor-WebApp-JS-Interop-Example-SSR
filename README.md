# BlazorApp1

This project was created to demonstrate how to use JS interop on the new .Net 8 Blazor Web App project with Server side rendering.

## Examples

The project contains two pages with examples of how to use JS interop, one using a js file and another using a ts file.

## Why doing an example when documentation is available?

Well, because the documentation is not clear enough and the examples are not complete. I had to search a lot and try a lot and make loads of mistakes until I got it working.

[JavaScript isolation in JavaScript modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-8.0#javascript-isolation-in-javascript-modules)

[Load a script from an external JavaScript file (`.js`) collocated with a component](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/javascript-interoperability/?view=aspnetcore-8.0#load-a-script-from-an-external-javascript-file-js-collocated-with-a-component)

I ended up creating also an example with typescript, just to give it a go and see if it would work. And it did.

## Colaboration

If you want to improve it and add more examples, feel free to do so. I will be happy to accept pull requests.
